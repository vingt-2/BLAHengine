BLAengine - OBJ viewer
===================================

"What's this ?"

=====

This code repository holds the current evolution of a simple realtime 3d rendering application.
The goal of this project is to help me gain proficiency in openGL programming:

The current target is to have a perfectly functionnal model viewer to test GSLS shaders on actual objects. I would then like to provide a gui to load multiple objects in the scene, and tools to place them in the world. 
Then I would add physics, collisions ... And eventually reach a point where I could actually use it as a game Engine for small projects.

To compile and run this code sample, make sur you provide your programming environmment with the required headers used in Graphics.h
You will currently need the headers for GLEW to enable OpenGL 3.0 and extensions, and GLFW (a GL toolkit utility), as well as the binaries for these libraries.

Cheers !
