BLAengine - OBJ viewer
===================================

"Vat is this ?"

=====

This code repository holds the current evolution of a 3d rendering engine currently written for OpenGL.

The demo application "MainDemo" of the engine is a model viewer with the controls:

* W,A,S,D to move the camera around.
* Right-Click + mouse to rotate the camera.
* F to apply a torque to the model.
* G to rotate the directionnal light in the scene.

More functionnality will be added and tested on the engine as it grows !

====
Installation:

To compile and run this code sample, make sur you provide your programming environmment with the required headers used in Graphics.h
You will currently need the headers for GLEW to enable OpenGL 3.0 and extensions, and GLFW (a GL toolkit utility), as well as the binaries for these libraries.

Cheers !
