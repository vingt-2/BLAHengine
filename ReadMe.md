BLAengine - MainDemo: Model Viewer
===================================

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/vingt-2/BLAengine/master/BlaEngine-picture.png)
=====

This code repository holds the current evolution of a 3d rendering engine currently written for OpenGL.

The demo application "MainDemo" of the engine is a model viewer with the controls:

* W,A,S,D to move the camera around.
* Right-Click + mouse to rotate the camera.
* F to apply a torque to the model.
* G to rotate the directionnal light in the scene.

More functionnality will be added and tested on the engine as it grows !

====
Installation:

To compile and run this code sample, make sure you provide your programming environmment with:
* GLEW to enable OpenGL 3.0 and extensions
* GLFW (a GL toolkit library).
* GLM, a C++ mathematics library for graphics programming that mimics GLSL maths definitions.

Make sure you get all the STD/*.h includes resolved and linked and you should be good to go ! 

Cheers !
