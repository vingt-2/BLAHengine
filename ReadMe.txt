    BLAengine - OBJ viewer
========================================================================
This code repository entitled BLAengine will hold the different evolutions of a basic realtime 3d rendering engine.
This project is just intended to help me gain proficiency in openGL programming. It now makes use of freeGLUT and many deprecated features of OpenGL 1.0, mostly through the use of immediate mode.

This is meant to evolve, and actually change quite a lot, as the next commit will likely look very different from this architecture, and will be based on OpenGL 4.0 specifications.

Do not use this current version for learning purposes, as all this is very much not useful anymore.
Cheers.
