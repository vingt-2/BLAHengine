    BLAengine - OBJ viewer
========================================================================

This code repository entitled BLAengine will hold the different evolutions of a basic realtime 3d rendering applications.
The goal of this project is to help me gain proficiency in openGL programming:

The current target is to have a perfectly functionnal OBJ viewer to test GSLS shaders on actual objects.
I would then like to provide a gui to load multiple object in the scene, and to be able to place them in the world.
Then i would add physics, collisions ... And continue like that until I get bored.

To be able to compile and run this code sample, you must provide the required headers to Graphics.h
You will currently need GLEW to enable OpenGL 3.0, and the headers for glfw (similar to GL toolkit utility).

Cheers.
